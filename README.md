# hello-world
This is my tutorial repository that I created, by following [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started).

I will document the task that I have completed from the guide stated above, throughout this *README* file. 

## Quickstart

In this part, I did the following:
- Created a new repo, called `hello-world`
- Created a *README* file
- Created a new branch for my *README* edits, creatively named `readme-edits`
- Got familiar with markdown language (still have to use the [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/))
- Added a picture of a character from one of my favorite cartoons to the end of this file
