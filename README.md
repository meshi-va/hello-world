# hello-world
This is my tutorial repository that I created, by following [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started).

I will document the task that I have completed from the guide stated above, throughout this *README* file.
Every task completed will be listed under each part.

## Quickstart

### Hello World

- Created a new repo, called `hello-world`
- Created a *README* file
- Created a new branch for my *README* edits, creatively named `readme-edits`
- Got familiar with markdown language (still have to use the [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/))
- Added a picture of a character from one of my favorite cartoons to the end of this file
- Committed changes
- Created and merged a pull request from `readme-edits` to `main`

### Set up Git

- Installed Git CLI
- Set my username
- Authenticated through `gh auth login`

### Fork a repo

- Forked and cloned [octocat/Spoon-Knife](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/) via Git CLI, using the command: `gh repo fork https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/`
